# Components V2

Embed Generator has experimental support for Discord's new Components V2. They replace regular embeds and can't be mixed with them.

With Components V2 you have more control over the look and feel of your messages. You can now add separators, multiple columns, images, and more.

**‚≠ê Some components are currently only available with Embed Generator Premium.**
